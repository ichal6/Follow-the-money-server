## Setup
1. Install Java 17
2. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 
3. Set up a new system environment: [tutorial for Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html)
   1. FTM_DATASOURCE_URL -> the url address for database (default for localhost: **jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres**)
   2. FTM_DATASOURCE_USERNAME -> the username, you should create it in database (default: **postgres**)
   3. FTM_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD -> password for user (set up when user was created)
   4. PORT -> select port for server (ex. 8080)
   5. FTM_SECRET -> secret for JWT (example from: [generator online](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/random/security-encryption-key-generator.aspx)). 512-bit should be ok (now is year 2023)
   6. You should restart your system
   7. If you run server from jar file active profile:
      1. dev -> Drop all database and insert dump data, enable debug mode 
      2. prod -> enable security connection
      3. [none] -> run app ond efault port and only connect with db
   8. If you run app from jar file you have to disable MultiRelease -> [bug in Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/33633):
   ```bash
   java -Djdk.util.jar.enableMultiRelease=false -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
   ```
4. Now program should work
